#+TITLE: wofi-iwd

This is a [[https://github.com/davatorium/rofi][Rofi]]/[[https://hg.sr.ht/~scoopta/wofi][Wofi]] (dmenu) interface for iwd for use connecting to networks. It
comes with a dbus-based helper script to provide raw SSIDs. This is to ease the
formatting required because SSIDs can contain any data.

This tool is meant to run in Sway/wlroots based Linux environments.

* Why
This was made to make the wifi scanning and connecting experience for IWD users
more intuitive. A simple menu selection interface is all I need to quickly
connect to WIFIs. I also wanted to ensure full data and UTF-8 support for SSID
connection, hence the additional scanning script.

* Usage

Simply run the ~wofi-iwd.sh~ script to issue an IWD scan to the target
interface. It will prompt for PSK passwords if the network is protected.

* Dependencies
1. iwd
2. wofi/rofi
3. python3
4. notify-send.sh

* Installation
You can clone this to ~$HOME/bin~ or some place accessible to you PATH and
launch it from a keyboard shortcut or using a ~waybar~ module.
